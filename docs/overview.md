This Shiny Application was built as part of the final project for the Coursera - Developing Data Products class.

The goal of this site is to look at the best NBA teams from the last 50+ years and compare their attibutes.  This application is very light-weight and bare-bones a specified by the project requirements.  There's most more that could be done with just this small amount of data  :)

Here's a brief description of the additional tabs:

* Shooting - Produces a graph showing the field goal and free throw shooting for the teams selected.
* Defense - Builds a plot displaying the steals and blocks per game for each team.
* Data - Shows the filtered data based on the selected options on the left.
